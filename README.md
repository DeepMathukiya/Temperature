# üå°Ô∏è Temperature Forecasting using Time Series Models

This project aims to forecast monthly maximum temperatures using time series forecasting techniques. Developed as part of a research internship at the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the project applies statistical and machine learning models to analyze and predict temperature patterns over time.



## üîç Overview

Accurate temperature forecasting is crucial for agriculture, disaster management, and climate studies. This project focuses on:

- Cleaning and visualizing temperature data
- Applying statistical and deep learning models
- Comparing model performance based on prediction accuracy

---

## ‚ú® Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Stationarity tests and decomposition
- ARIMA, SARIMA modeling
- LSTM-based deep learning model
- Visual comparison of model performance
